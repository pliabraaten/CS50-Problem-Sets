AVG(energy)= 0.65906
AVG(danceability) = 0.71646
AVG(valence) = 0.484443

Based on these calculations, the aura is not super happy but still danceable. I would characterize the audio aura as reflective and emotional.

I calculated the aura based on averages of energy, danceability, and valence across the 100 songs; however, any outliers in this list could very much skew the result.
For instance, if the listener had only a few songs with the highest value in one of these areas, it could misrepresent what the listener listened to the majority of the time.
A better way to calculate this is by using median values instead of averages.
